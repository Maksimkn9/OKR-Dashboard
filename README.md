Main features of OKR dashboard:
 
Must have:
•	Create objective and assign it to a user and specify objective year.
•	Create key result and connect it to the objective.
•	Set targets for key results and keep track of completed targets.
•	Relate calls, events, opportunities, contracts, leads (only from web), surveys, reviews, google reviews, case studies to the key result. Some of those objects are not system objects, so custom objects need to be created.
•	Create reviews, google reviews, case studies, surveys in OKR Dashboard and relate them to Key Result record selected by user.
•	Specify and determine types of events/calls/contracts to measure against the target. Available Contract types must be specified as custom picklist field values (choose your own values).
